Important files:

    - Stack implementation:             src/rpn-stack.c
    - Calculator implementation:        src/rpn.c
    - Stack tests:                      test/check_rpn-stack.c
    - Calculator tests:                 test/check_rpn
    - Test coverage for both problems:  gcccoverage.png.

How to Compile

Make sure you are in the project directory:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

If you want to run tests go in the build/test directory:

$ ./check_rpn-stack
$ ./check_rpn

To generate test coverage, first do all the steps before!!! Then:

$ lcov --capture --directory . --output-file cov.info
$ genhtml cov.info -o html
$ cd html

Inside this folder you can find the test coverage .html file for both problems.
